# Restaurant-management

In this project I made a restaurant management application. We have 3 different GUI for 3 users: restaurant manager, waiter and chef.Every user had different taks to make.
I used de Observer Design Pattern for communication between waiter and chef.

The manager can to insert a new product in Menu, delete a product, modify a product, view all products.
The waiter can make a new order, view all orders and create a bill for an order.
The chef waits until he is notify by the waiter.
